<p>There is an opinion that a team should be broken by three layers: junior, middle and senior.</p>
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s enough to have at least one weak developer in the team to lose a lot of time for the whole team.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C. A. R. Hoare)</div></blockquote>
<p>Do you know the Primary Technical Imperative of software development?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Managing complexity is the most important technical topic in software development. In my view, it&#8217;s so important that Software&#8217;s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
(&#8220;Code Complete&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id1">[4]</a> by Steve McConnell)</div></blockquote>
<p>During code construction developer reads code for 91% of the time, and only for 9% of the time he types text from keyboard.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn’t most of the effort go into
writing it?</p>
<p>Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had editors like Emacs
that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for an hour and then play back your whole
edit session like a high-speed movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other modules!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bob enters the module.</li>
<li>He scrolls down to the function needing change.</li>
<li>He pauses, considering his options.</li>
<li>Oh, he’s scrolling up to the top of the module to check the initialization of a variable.</li>
<li>Now he scrolls back down and begins to type.</li>
<li>Ooops, he’s erasing what he typed!</li>
<li>He types it again.</li>
<li>He erases it again!</li>
<li>He types half of something else but then erases that!</li>
<li>He scrolls down to another function that calls the function he’s changing to see how it is called.</li>
<li>He scrolls back up and types the same code he just erased.</li>
<li>He pauses.</li>
<li>He erases that code again!</li>
<li>He pops up another window and looks at a subclass. Is that function overridden?</li>
</ul>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>You get the drift. Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1.
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.</p>
<p>Because this ratio is so high, we want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes
the writing harder. Of course there’s no way to write code without reading it, so making it
easy to read actually makes it easier to write.</p>
<p>There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the sur-
rounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write
depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to go fast,
if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to
read.

<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;Dijkstra pointed out that no one&#8217;s skull is really big enough to contain a modern
computer program (Dijkstra 1972), which means that we as software developers
shouldn&#8217;t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize
our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal
is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You
might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you
to keep in the air at once, the more likely you&#8217;ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design
or coding error.</p>
<p>At the software-architecture level, the complexity of a problem is reduced by dividing
the system into subsystems. Humans have an easier time comprehending several simple
pieces of information than one complicated piece. The goal of all software-design
techniques is to break a complicated problem into simple pieces. The more independent
the subsystems are, the more you make it safe to focus on one bit of complexity at a
time. Carefully defined objects separate concerns so that you can focus on one thing at a
time. Packages provide the same benefit at a higher level of aggregation.</p>
<p>Keeping routines short helps reduce your mental workload. Writing programs in terms
of the problem domain, rather than in terms of low-level implementation details, and
working at the highest level of abstraction reduce the load on your brain.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that programmers who compensate for inherent human limitations
write code that&#8217;s easier for themselves and others to understand and that has fewer
errors.&#8221;

<blockquote>
<div>Software&#8217;s Primary Technical Imperative is managing complexity. This is greatly
aided by a design focus on simplicity.
Simplicity is achieved in two general ways: minimizing the amount of essential
complexity that anyone&#8217;s brain has to deal with at any one time, and keeping
accidental complexity from proliferating needlessly.

<div>The number
&#8220;7±2&#8221; has been found to be a number of discrete items a person can remember while
performing other tasks (Miller 1956). If a class contains more than about seven data

classes (Riel 1996).

<blockquote>
<div><p>Collective ownership increases your feeling of personal power on a project. On an XP
project you are never stuck with someone else&#8217;s stupidity. You see something in the
way, you get it out of the way. If you choose to live with something for the moment
80because it is expedient, that is your business. But you&#8217;re never stuck. So you never
get the sense that, &#8220;I could get my work done, if only I didn&#8217;t have to deal with these
other idiots.&#8221; One less frustration. One step closer to clear thinking.</p>
<p>Collective ownership also tends to spread knowledge of the system around the team.
It is unlikely that there will ever be a part of the system that only two people know
(it has to be at least a pair, which is already better than the usual situation where
one smart programmer holds everyone else hostage). This further reduces project
risk.

<blockquote>
<div><p>These were elucidated in the mid-70s by Yourdon &amp; Constantine in Structured Design and haven’t changed.
Their argument goes like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>We design software to reduce its cost.</li>
<li>The cost of software is ≈ the cost of changing the software.</li>
<li>The cost of changing the software is ≈ the cost of the expensive changes (power laws and all that).</li>
<li>The cost of the expensive changes is generated by cascading changes — if I change this then I have to change that and that, and if I change that then…</li>
<li>Coupling between elements of a design is this propensity for a change to propagate.</li>
<li>So, design ≈ cost ≈ change ≈ big change ≈ coupling. Transitively, software design ≈ managing coupling.</li>
</ol>
<p>(This skips loads of interesting stuff, but I’m just trying to set up the argument for why rapid decomposition of a monolith into micro-services is counter-productive.)</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus, when one developer writes an unreadable code for 9% of his time, this code slows down the development velocity of the whole team by 91%.
The code is written once, but is read incommensurably many times in the development process.</p>
<p>The emphasis on &#8220;fast writing&#8221; code actually leads to reduction in the development velocity in geometric progression. And the emphasis on &#8220;readability&#8221; of code leads to an increase in the development velocity, also in an geometric progression.</p>
<p>The number of objects an average human can hold in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">working memory is 7 ± 2</a>.
That&#8217;s why good <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EtymologyOfRefactoring.html">decomposition is important</a>.
That&#8217;s why good encapsulation and abstraction are important.</p>
<p>If the code is not readable, has bad code navigation, bad decomposition, a lot of code smells, hight coupling, low cohesion, violates SRP, OCP principles, has poor test coverage, doesn&#8217;t uses type hinting and doesn&#8217;t allow to use automated refactoring, then this code slows rate of development for 91% of time of the whole team.</p>
<p>Thus, each developer in the team MUST be a senior developer.
The best way to achieve it is to use XP of Kent Beck.</p>
<p>Experience sharing is the rule №1 for the high-skilled team.
If your team still has the junior developer after two months, your team needs a better manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Pair programming is also not a tutoring session. Sometimes pairs contain one
partner with much more experience than the other partner. When this is true, the
first few sessions will look a lot like tutoring. The junior partner will ask lots of
questions, and type very little. Very quickly, though, the junior partner will start
catching stupid little mistakes, like unbalanced parentheses. The senior partner will
notice the help. After a few more weeks, the junior partner will start picking up the
larger patterns that the senior partner is using, and notice deviations from those
patterns.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, typically, the gap between the partners is not nearly so
noticeable as it was at first. The junior partner is typing more regularly. The pair
notices that each of them has strengths and weaknesses. Productivity, quality, and
satisfaction rise.

<blockquote>
<div><p>So, why does pair programming work for XP? Well, the first value is communication,
and there are few forms of communication more intense than face-to-face. So, pair
programming works for XP because it encourages communication. I like to think of
the analogy of a pool of water. When an important new bit of information is learned
by someone on the team, it is like putting a drop of dye in the water. Because of the
pairs switching around all the time, the information rapidly diffuses throughout the
team just as the dye spreads throughout the pool. Unlike the dye, however, the
information becomes richer and more intense as it spreads and is enriched by the
experience and insight of everyone on the team.</p>
<p>In my experience, pair programming is more productive than dividing the work
between two programmers and then integrating the results. Pair programming is
often a sticking point for folks wanting to adopt XP. All I can say is that you should
get good at it, then try an iteration where you pair for all production code and
another where you program everything solo. Then you can make your own decision.

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id74">The second myth. Quality code is not suitable for hot deadline.</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-myth-quality-code-is-not-suitable-for-hot-deadline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Team doesn&#8217;t have time to write high-quality code, because they have a hot deadline.</p>
<p>In reality you have the hot deadline because you have the unpredictable codebase which requires a lot of your time.
You spend a lot of time to try to understand messy mishmash of a code.
Sometimes you are able to understand the code only with debugger.
Your code has a poor test coverage, therefore you spend a lot of time for bugfixes.
Sometimes you are not able to implement a some feature due to poor design, but you also can&#8217;t to refactor the code because of the poor test coverage.
Your code has a lot of duplicates which are the cause of a lot of bugs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The General Principle of Software Quality is
that improving quality reduces development costs.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle depends on understanding a key observation: the best way
to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether
the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging. The
industry-average productivity for a software product is about 10 to 50 of lines of
delivered code per person per day (including all noncoding overhead). It takes only a
matter of minutes to type in 10 to 50 lines of code, so how is the rest of the day spent?
Part of the reason for these seemingly low productivity figures is that industry average
numbers like these factor nonprogrammer time into the lines-of-code-per-day figure.
Tester time, project manager time, and administrative support time are all included.
Noncoding activities, such as requirements development and architecture work, are also
typically factored into those lines-of-code-per-day figures. But none of that is what
takes up so much time.</p>
<p>The single biggest activity on most projects is debugging and correcting code that
doesn&#8217;t work properly. Debugging and associated refactoring and other rework consume
about 50 percent of the time on a traditional, naive software-development cycle. (See
Section 3.1, &#8220;Importance of Prerequisites,&#8221; for more details.) Reducing debugging by
preventing errors improves productivity. Therefore, the most obvious method of
shortening a development schedule is to improve the quality of the product and decrease
the amount of time spent debugging and reworking the software.
This analysis is confirmed by field data. In a review of 50
development projects involving over 400 work-years of effort and
almost 3 million lines of code, a study at NASA&#8217;s Software
Engineering Laboratory found that increased quality assurance was
associated with decreased error rate but did not increase overalldevelopment cost (Card 1987).</p>
<p>A study at IBM produced similar findings:</p>
<p>Software projects with the lowest levels of defects had the shortest development
schedules and the highest development productivity.... software defect removal is
actually the most expensive and time-consuming form of work for software (Jones
2000).</p>
<p>The same effect holds true at the small end of the scale. In a 1985
study, 166 professional programmers wrote programs from the
same specification. The resulting programs averaged 220 lines of
code and a little under five hours to write. The fascinating result
was that programmers who took the median time to complete their
programs produced programs with the greatest number of errors.
The programmers who took more or less than the median time
produced programs with significantly fewer errors (DeMarco and
Lister 1985).</p>
<p>The two slowest groups took about five times as long to achieve roughly the same
defect rate as the fastest group. It&#8217;s not necessarily the case that writing software without
defects takes more time than writing software with defects. As the graph shows, it can
take less.

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Watts Humphrey reports that teams using the Team Software Process
(TSP) have achieved defect levels of about 0.06 defects per 1000 lines of code.
TSP focuses on training developers not to create defects in the first place (Weber
2003).</p>
<p>The results of the TSP and cleanroom projects confirm another version of the General
Principle of Software Quality: it&#8217;s cheaper to build high-quality software than it is to
build and fix low-quality software. Productivity for a fully checked-out, 80,000-line
cleanroom project was 740 lines of code per work-month. The industry average rate for
fully checked-out code is closer to 250–300 lines per work-month, including all
noncoding overhead (Cusumano et al 2003). The cost savings and productivity come
from the fact that virtually no time is devoted to debugging on TSP or cleanroom
projects. No time spent on debugging? That is truly a worthy goal!

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Quality is another strange variable. Often, by insisting on better quality you can get
projects done sooner, or you can get more done in a given amount of time. This
happened to me when I started writing unit tests...
As soon as I had my tests, I had so much more
confidence in my code that I wrote faster, without stress. I could clean up my
system more easily, which made further development easier. I&#8217;ve also seen this
happen with teams. As soon as they start testing, or as soon as they agree on coding
standards, they start going faster.</p>
<p>There is a strange relationship between internal and external quality. External quality
is quality as measured by the customer. Internal quality is quality as measured by
the programmers. Temporarily sacrificing internal quality to reduce time to market in
hopes that external quality won&#8217;t suffer too much is a tempting short-term play. And
you can often get away with making a mess for a matter of weeks or months.
Eventually, though, internal quality problems will catch up with you and make your
software prohibitively expensive to maintain, or unable to reach a competitive level
of external quality.

<blockquote>
<div><p>Why can&#8217;t you just listen, write a test case, make it run, listen, write a test case,
make it run indefinitely? Because we know it doesn&#8217;t work that way. You can do that
for a while. In a forgiving language you may even be able to do that for a long while.
Eventually, though, you get stuck. The only way to make the next test case run is to
break another. Or the only way to make the test case run is far more trouble than it
is worth. Entropy claims another victim.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid this is to design. Designing is creating a structure that
organizes the logic in the system. Good design organizes the logic so that a change
45 in one part of the system doesn&#8217;t always require a change in another part of the system.
Good design ensures that every piece of logic in the system has one and only one home.
Good design puts the logic near the data it operates allows the extension of the system with changes in only one place.

a shared understanding of the system design. <strong>This shared understanding is called ‘architecture.’</strong>
This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces.
These components are usually composed of smaller components, but the architecture only
includes the components and interfaces that are understood by all the developers.

<div><p>Sadly, software developers usually don&#8217;t do a good job of explaining this situation.
Countless times I&#8217;ve talked to development teams who say &#8220;they (management) won&#8217;t let us write good quality code because it takes too long&#8221;.
Developers often justify attention to quality by justifying through the need for proper professionalism.
But this moralistic argument implies that this quality comes at a cost - dooming their argument.
The annoying thing is that the resulting crufty code both makes developers&#8217; lives harder, and costs the customer money.
When thinking about internal quality, I stress that we should only approach it as an economic argument.
High internal quality reduces the cost of future features, meaning that putting the time into writing good code actually reduces cost.</p>
<p>This is why the question that heads this article misses the point.
The &#8220;cost&#8221; of high internal quality software is negative.
The usual trade-off between cost and quality, one that we are used to for most decisions in our life, does not make sense with the internal quality of software.
(It does for external quality, such as a carefully crafted user-experience.)
Because the relationship between cost and internal quality is an unusual and counter-intuitive relationship, it&#8217;s usually hard to absorb.
But understanding it is critical to developing software at maximum efficiency.</p>

<div><p>Refactoring Helps Me Program Faster</p>
<p>In the end, all the earlier points come down to this: Refactoring helps me develop code more quickly.</p>
<p>This sounds counterintuitive.
When I talk about refactoring, people can easily see that it improves quality.
Better internal design, readability, reducing bugs—all theseimprove quality.
But doesn’t the time I spend on refactoring reduce the speed of development?</p>
<p>When I talk to software developers who have been working on a system for a while, I often hear that they were able to make progress rapidly at first, but now it takes much longer to add new features.
Every new feature requires more and more time to understand how to fit it into the existing code base, and once it’s added, bugs often crop up that take even longer to fix.
The code base starts looking like a series of patches covering patches, and it takes an exercise in archaeology to figure out how things work.
This burden slows down adding new features — to the point that developers wish they could start again from a blank slate.</p>
<p>I can visualize this state of affairs with <a class="reference internal" href="#design-stamina-graph-en"><span class="std std-ref">the following pseudograph</span></a>.</p>
<p>But some teams report a different experience.
They find they can add new features faster because they can leverage the existing things by quickly building on what’s already there.</p>
<p>The difference between these two is the internal quality of the software.
Software with a good internal design allows me to easily find how and where I need to make changes to add a new feature.
Good modularity allows me to only have to understand a small subset of the code base to make a change.
If the code is clear, I’m less likely to introduce a bug, and if I do, the debugging effort is much easier.
Done well, my code base turns into a platform for building new features for its domain.</p>
<p>I refer to this effect as the <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html">Design Stamina Hypothesis</a>:
By putting our effort into a good internal design, we increase the stamina of the software effort, allowing us to go faster for longer.
I can’t prove that this is the case, which is why I refer to it as a hypothesis.
But it explains my experience, together with the experience of hundreds of great programmers that I’ve got to know over my career.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the conventional wisdom was that to get this kind of good design, it had to be completed before starting to program — because once we wrote the code, we could only face decay.
Refactoring changes this picture. We now know we can improve the design of existing code—so we can form and improve a design over time, even as the needs of the program change.
Since it is very difficult to do a good design up front, refactoring becomes vital to achieving that virtuous path of rapid functionality.</p>

<p>There is an opinion that pair programming reduces the velocity of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Studies at the Software Engineering
Institute have found that developers insert an average of 1 to 3
defects per hour into their designs and 5 to 8 defects per hour into
code (Humphrey 1997), so attacking these blind spots is a key to
effective construction.
(&#8220;Code Complete&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id18">[4]</a> by Steve McConnell)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The primary purpose of collaborative construction is to improve
software quality. As noted in Chapter 20, &#8220;The Software-Quality
Landscape,&#8221; software testing has limited effectiveness when used
alone—the average defect-detection rate is only about 30 percent
for unit testing, 35 percent for integration testing, and 35 percent
for low-volume beta testing. In contrast, the average
effectivenesses of design and code inspections are 55 and 60
percent (Jones 1996). The secondary benefit of collaborative
construction is that it decreases development time, which in turn
lowers development costs.</p>
<p>Early reports on pair programming suggest that it can achieve a
code-quality level similar to formal inspections (Shull et al 2002).
The cost of full-up pair programming is probably higher than the
cost of solo development—on the order of 10–25 percent higher—
but the reduction in development time appears to be on the order of
45 percent, which in some cases may be a decisive advantage over
solo development (Boehm and Turner 2004), although not over
inspections which have produced similar results.

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A number of these cases illustrate the General Principle of Software Quality, which
holds that reducing the number of defects in the software also improves development
time.</p>
<p>Various studies have shown that in addition to being more effective
at catching errors than testing, collaborative practices find different
kinds of errors than testing does (Myers 1978; Basili, Selby, and
Hutchens 1986). As Karl Wiegers points out, &#8220;A human reviewer
can spot unclear error messages, inadequate comments, hard-coded
variable values, and repeated code patterns that should be
consolidated. Testing won&#8217;t&#8221; (Wiegers 2002). A secondary effect is
that when people know their work will be reviewed, they scrutinize
it more carefully. Thus, even when testing is done effectively,
reviews or other kinds of collaboration are needed as part of a
comprehensive quality program.

<blockquote>
<div>Informal review procedures were passed on from person to person in the general culture
of computing for many years before they were acknowledged in print. The need for
reviewing was so obvious to the best programmers that they rarely mentioned it in print,
while the worst programmers believed they were so good that their work did not need
reviewing. (Daniel Freedman and Gerald Weinberg)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In addition to feedback about how well they follow standards, programmers need
feedback about more subjective aspects of programming: formatting, comments,
variable names, local and global variable use, design approaches, the-way-we-do-
things-around-here, and so on. Programmers who are still wet behind the ears need
guidance from those who are more knowledgeable, and more knowledgeable
programmers who tend to be busy need to be encouraged to spend time sharing what
they know. Reviews create a venue for more experienced and less experienced
programmers to communicate about technical issues. As such, reviews are an
opportunity for cultivating quality improvements in the future as much as in the present.</p>
<p>One team that used formal inspections reported that inspections quickly brought all the
developers up to the level of the best developers (Tackett and Van Doren 1999).

<blockquote>
<div><p>Collective Ownership Applies to All Forms of Collaborative Construction</p>
<p>With collective ownership, all code is owned by the group rather than by individuals
and can be accessed and modified by various members of the group. This produces
several valuable benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Better code quality arises from multiple sets of eyes seeing the code and multiple programmers working on the code.</li>
<li>The impact of someone leaving the project is lessened because multiple people are familiar with each section of code.</li>
<li>Defect-correction cycles are shorter overall because any of several programmers can potentially be assigned to fix bugs on an as-available basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some methodologies, such as Extreme Programming, recommend formally pairing
programmers and rotating their work assignments over time. At my company, we&#8217;ve
found that programmers don&#8217;t need to pair up formally to achieve good code coverage.
Over time we achieve cross-coverage through a combination of formal and informal
technical reviews, pair programming when needed, and rotation of defectcorrection
assignments.

<blockquote>
<div><p>Pair programming produces numerous benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It holds up better under stress than solo development. Pairs encourage each other to keep code quality high even when there&#8217;s pressure to write quick and dirty code.</li>
<li>It improves code quality. The readability and understandability of the code tends to rise to the level of the best programmer on the team.</li>
<li>It shortens schedules. Pairs tend to write code faster and with fewer errors. The project team spends less time at the end of the project correcting defects.</li>
<li>It produces all the other general benefits of collaborative construction, including disseminating corporate culture, mentoring junior programmers, and fostering collective ownership.</li>

<blockquote>
<div>Pair programming typically costs about the same as inspections and produces
similar quality code. Pair programming is especially valuable when schedule
reduction is desired. Some developers prefer working in pairs to working solo.

<div>In my experience, pair programming is more productive than dividing the work
between two programmers and then integrating the results.

<p>The main conclusion is that you can&#8217;t say about affect of pair programming to velocity of development until you begin to track the time of your team for bugfixes, refactoring and debugging.</p>
<p>Please do not confuse &#8220;Inspection&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id26">[4]</a> (or &#8220;Code Reading&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id27">[4]</a>) and usual Code Review on github.
Inspection is a kind of Collaborative Development Practice, while usual Code Review usually involves only 2 persons (reviewer and author).
Code Review is weak for experience sharing.
Also, usual Code Review does not require any preparation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>90 percent of the defects were
found in preparation for the review meeting, and only about 10
percent were found during the review itself (Votta 1991, Glass
1999).
(&#8220;Code Complete&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fncodec" id="id28">[4]</a> by Steve McConnell)</div></blockquote>
<p>There was one real example of my practice.
We had a ticket for 3 days of development had been assigned to the new developer.
It was a talented developer, but he had a lack of knowledges for the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The new developer solved the ticket during 6 days, because he needed a time to understand the program.</li>
<li>Then I spent 1-2 days for a few of Code Reviews with fixes.</li>
<li>Eventually I understood that I spent a lot of time and I approved the incomplete pull request with a lot of design mistakes. Also product team insisted on merge the pull request even with bugs.</li>
<li>After it, when I was developing my own ticket and I saw that this mistakes interfere to my implementation, I did the refactoring of the mistakes and spent about a day for refactoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we both spent 6 + 2 * 2 + 1 = 11 days.
If we used &#8220;Continued Review&#8221; of XP we would spent 3 * 2 = 6 days + growing the skills of the new developer.
Next time he would be able to solve the issue independently.</p>

The <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?CouplingAndCohesion">low coupling and high cohesion</a> is the most important criteria of code quality.
Low coupling reduces the complexity of the code.
It&#8217;s simplification, not the complication.
It allows to limit the attention necessary to understand this responsibility of the code.
Thus, patterns is not complexity.</p>
<p>The quality code is always simple!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;On the surface, being an XP programmer looks a lot like being a programmer within
other software development disciplines. You spend your time working with programs,
making them bigger, simpler, faster. Beneath the surface, however, the focus is
quite different. Your job isn&#8217;t over when the computer understands what to do. Your
first value is communication with other people. If the program runs, but there is
some vital component of communication left to be done, you aren&#8217;t done. You write
tests that demonstrate some vital aspect of the software. You break the program
into more smaller pieces, or merge pieces that are too small into larger, more
coherent pieces. You find a system of names that more accurately reflects your
intent.</p>
<p>This may sound like a high-minded pursuit of perfection. It is anything but. You try
to develop the most valuable software for the customer, but not to develop anything
that isn&#8217;t valuable. If you can reduce the size of the problem enough, then you can
afford to be careful with the work you do on what remains. Then, you are careful by
habit.&#8221;

<div>&#8220;One pattern I see time and time again on software teams is that they adopt Scrum, pay little attention to technical practices, and they’re able to consistently increase their velocity for the first few years.
But after about three or four years the technical debt they’ve accumulated in their code is so great that their velocity starts to grind to a halt and they find it difficult to even get simple features implemented.
This is a place you do not want to get to, though I see it far too often in the software community—teams stuck there without a clue how to get out.&#8221;

<p>Often people understand the word &#8220;agile&#8221; as a simple set of iterations.
But the true agile is to keep the cost of code change low, so the customer will be able to adapt the codebase for variable business requirements.</p>

<p>The cost of change rising exponentially over time. The image from the book &#8220;Extreme Programming&#8221; by Kent Beck.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At the core of understanding this argument is the software change curve.
The change curve says that as the project runs, it becomes exponentially more expensive to make changes.
The change curve is usually expressed in terms of phases &#8220;a change made in analysis for $1 would cost thousands to fix in production&#8221;.
This is ironic as most projects still work in an ad-hoc process that doesn&#8217;t have an analysis phase, but the exponentiation is still there.
The exponential change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work.
It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation.</p>
<p>The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work.
This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP.
This is part of the coupling of the XP practices: specifically you can&#8217;t do those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing those things that enable the flattening.
This is a common source of the controversy over XP.
Many people criticize the exploitation without understanding the enabling.
Often the criticisms stem from critics&#8217; own experience where they didn&#8217;t do the enabling practices that allow the exploiting practices to work.
As a result they got burned and when they see XP they remember the fire.

<div><p>&#8220;This is one of the premises of XP. It is the technical premise of XP. If the cost of
change rose slowly over time, you would act completely differently from how you do
under the assumption that costs rise exponentially. You would make big decisions as
late in the process as possible, to defer the cost of making the decisions and to have
the greatest possible chance that they would be right. You would only implement
what you had to, in hopes that the needs you anticipate for tomorrow wouldn&#8217;t come
true. You would introduce elements to the design only as they simplified existing
code or made writing the next bit of code simpler.</p>
<p>If a flattened change cost curve makes XP possible, a steep change cost curve makes
XP impossible. If change is ruinously expensive, you would be crazy to charge ahead
without careful forethought. But if change stays cheap, the additional value and
reduced risk of early concrete feedback outweighs the additional cost of early
change.&#8221;

<div>&#8220;Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology developed primarily by Kent Beck.
XP was one of the first agile methods, indeed XP was the dominant agile method in the late 90s and early 00s before Scrum became dominant as the noughties passed.
Many people (including myself) consider XP to be the primary catalyst that got attention to agile methods, and superior to Scrum as a base for starting out in agile development.&#8221;

<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster.
The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc tactical decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter.
In many ways you might argue this is no design, certainly it usually leads to a poor design.
As Kent puts it, design is there to enable you to keep changing the software easily in the long term.
As design deteriorates, so does your ability to make changes effectively.
You have the state of software entropy, over time the design gets worse and worse.
Not only does this make the software harder to change, it also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely kill.
This is the &#8220;code and fix&#8221; nightmare, where the bugs become exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on.&#8221;

<div>&#8220;To make agile work, you need solid technical practices.
A lot of agile education under-emphasizes these, but if you skimp on this you won&#8217;t gain the productivity and responsiveness benefits that agile development can give you (stranding you at level 1 of the agile fluency model.)
This is one of the reasons that I still think that Extreme Programming is the most valuable of the named agile methods as a core and starting point.&#8221;

<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;From the very earliest days of agile methods, people have asked what role there is for architectural or design thinking.
A common misconception is that since agile methods drop the notion of a detailed up-front design artifact, that there is no room for architecture in an agile project.
In my keynote at the first-ever agile conference, I pointed out that design was every bit as important for agile projects, but it manifests itself differently, becoming an evolutionary approach.&#8221;

This is a strawman argument.
The alternative to designing before implementing is designing after implementing.
Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation.
Further design takes place once the implementation is in place and the real constraints on the design are obvious.
Far from &#8220;design nothing,&#8221; the XP strategy is &#8220;design always.&#8221;

&#8220;guessing at the future&#8221; behavior. Fortunately, most folks can unlearn the habit of
&#8220;borrowing trouble&#8221; (as my grandmother called it). Unfortunately, the smarter you

<p>The cause of this effect is that smart people tends to think in upfront way.
Furthermore, usually the developer does not have enough information to make right decisions about implementation at the moment.

<div>&#8220;We often forget that it is also best to postpone decisions until the last possible moment.
This isn’t lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information.

much less customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with our
implementation choices if we decide too soon.&#8221;

I.e. this is the management problem.</p>

or other is in everybody&#8217;s best interest long-term, but when the pressure mounts, if
the practice doesn&#8217;t solve an immediate problem it will be discarded. If XP can&#8217;t work
with people&#8217;s short-term interest, it is doomed to the outer methodological darkness.

<p>To be effective, the smart developer has to understand the economy of software development, has to have enough knowledges about design and architecture, and has to use &#8220;<a class="reference internal" href="#use-designing-through-refactoring">Designing Through Refactoring</a>&#8221;.
Smart developers usually tend to work fast only with smart managers.
If a manager does not able to use potential of smart developers in iterative way, the smart developers usually tend to find a lot of non-iterative upfront things (&#8220;borrowing trouble&#8221;) for their brain.
But the economy always wins.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If the cost of today&#8217;s decision is high, and the probability of its being right is low, and
the probability of knowing a better way tomorrow is high, and the cost of putting in
the design tomorrow is low, then we can conclude that we should never make a
design decision today if we don&#8217;t need it today. In fact, that is what XP concludes.
&#8220;Sufficient to the day are the troubles thereof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, several factors can make the above evaluation null and void. If the cost of
making the change tomorrow is very much higher, then we should make the decision
today on the off chance that we are right. If the inertia of the design is low enough
(for example, you have really, really smart people), then the benefits of just-in-time
design are less. If you are a really, really good guesser, then you could go ahead and
design everything today. For the rest of us, however, I don&#8217;t see any alternative to
the conclusion that today&#8217;s design should be done today and tomorrow&#8217;s design
should be done tomorrow.

<p>Many times I saw how talented developers lost motivation due to management mistakes and left the company.
Once I saw how the tight-knit collective with high self-motivation was destroyed for a couple of weeks after the change of the management.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.&#8221; (Henry Ford)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>There is a human effect from quality. Everybody wants to do a good job, and they
work much better if they feel they are doing good work. If you deliberately
downgrade quality, your team might go faster at first, but soon the demoralization of
producing crap will overwhelm any gains you temporarily made from not testing, or
not reviewing, or not sticking to standards.
(&#8220;Extreme Programming Explained&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnxp" id="id61">[7]</a> by Kent Beck)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>This points to a deeper value, one that lies below the surface of the other four —
respect. If members of a team don&#8217;t care about each other and what they are doing,
XP is doomed.
(&#8220;Extreme Programming Explained&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#fnxp" id="id62">[7]</a> by Kent Beck)</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>If members of a team don&#8217;t care about the project, nothing can
save it. Given some minimal passion, XP provides some positive feedback. This is not
manipulative; it&#8217;s just enjoying being part of something that works, instead of part of
something that doesn&#8217;t work.
