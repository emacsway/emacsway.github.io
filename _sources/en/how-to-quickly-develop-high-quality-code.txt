This article is about how to write high-quality code quickly.
This article focuses mainly on architects and managers, so there's a lot of quotes of famous architects.

Myths
=====

There are several myths:


The first myth. Horizontal stratification of team.
--------------------------------------------------

There is an opinion that a team should be broken by three layers: junior, middle and senior.

The truth is that it's enough to have at least one weak developer in the team to lose a lot of time for the whole team.

    There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C. A. R. Hoare)

Do you know the Primary Technical Imperative of software development?

    Managing complexity is the most important technical topic in software development. In my view, it's so important that Software's Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

During code construction developer reads code for 91% of the time, and only for 9% of the time he types text from keyboard.

    You might ask: How much is code really read? Doesn’t most of the effort go into
    writing it?

    Have you ever played back an edit session? In the 80s and 90s we had editors like Emacs
    that kept track of every keystroke. You could work for an hour and then play back your whole
    edit session like a high-speed movie. When I did this, the results were fascinating.

    The vast majority of the playback was scrolling and navigating to other modules!

    - Bob enters the module.
    - He scrolls down to the function needing change.
    - He pauses, considering his options.
    - Oh, he’s scrolling up to the top of the module to check the initialization of a variable.
    - Now he scrolls back down and begins to type.
    - Ooops, he’s erasing what he typed!
    - He types it again.
    - He erases it again!
    - He types half of something else but then erases that!
    - He scrolls down to another function that calls the function he’s changing to see how it is called.
    - He scrolls back up and types the same code he just erased.
    - He pauses.
    - He erases that code again!
    - He pops up another window and looks at a subclass. Is that function overridden?

    . . .

    You get the drift. Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1.
    We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.

    Because this ratio is so high, we want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes
    the writing harder. Of course there’s no way to write code without reading it, so making it
    easy to read actually makes it easier to write.

    There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the sur-
    rounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write
    depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to go fast,
    if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to
    read.

    "Dijkstra pointed out that no one's skull is really big enough to contain a modern
    computer program (Dijkstra 1972), which means that we as software developers
    shouldn't try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize
    our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal
    is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You
    might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you
    to keep in the air at once, the more likely you'll drop one of the balls, leading to a design
    or coding error.

    At the software-architecture level, the complexity of a problem is reduced by dividing
    the system into subsystems. Humans have an easier time comprehending several simple
    pieces of information than one complicated piece. The goal of all software-design
    techniques is to break a complicated problem into simple pieces. The more independent
    the subsystems are, the more you make it safe to focus on one bit of complexity at a
    time. Carefully defined objects separate concerns so that you can focus on one thing at a
    time. Packages provide the same benefit at a higher level of aggregation.

    Keeping routines short helps reduce your mental workload. Writing programs in terms
    of the problem domain, rather than in terms of low-level implementation details, and
    working at the highest level of abstraction reduce the load on your brain.

    The bottom line is that programmers who compensate for inherent human limitations
    write code that's easier for themselves and others to understand and that has fewer
    errors."
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Software's Primary Technical Imperative is managing complexity. This is greatly
    aided by a design focus on simplicity.
    Simplicity is achieved in two general ways: minimizing the amount of essential
    complexity that anyone's brain has to deal with at any one time, and keeping
    accidental complexity from proliferating needlessly.

    The number
    "7±2" has been found to be a number of discrete items a person can remember while
    performing other tasks (Miller 1956). If a class contains more than about seven data
    members, consider whether the class should be decomposed into multiple smaller
    classes (Riel 1996).
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Collective ownership increases your feeling of personal power on a project. On an XP
    project you are never stuck with someone else's stupidity. You see something in the
    way, you get it out of the way. If you choose to live with something for the moment
    80because it is expedient, that is your business. But you're never stuck. So you never
    get the sense that, "I could get my work done, if only I didn't have to deal with these
    other idiots." One less frustration. One step closer to clear thinking.

    Collective ownership also tends to spread knowledge of the system around the team.
    It is unlikely that there will ever be a part of the system that only two people know
    (it has to be at least a pair, which is already better than the usual situation where
    one smart programmer holds everyone else hostage). This further reduces project
    risk.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    These were elucidated in the mid-70s by Yourdon & Constantine in Structured Design and haven’t changed.
    Their argument goes like this:

    #. We design software to reduce its cost.
    #. The cost of software is ≈ the cost of changing the software.
    #. The cost of changing the software is ≈ the cost of the expensive changes (power laws and all that).
    #. The cost of the expensive changes is generated by cascading changes — if I change this then I have to change that and that, and if I change that then…
    #. Coupling between elements of a design is this propensity for a change to propagate.
    #. So, design ≈ cost ≈ change ≈ big change ≈ coupling. Transitively, software design ≈ managing coupling.

    (This skips loads of interesting stuff, but I’m just trying to set up the argument for why rapid decomposition of a monolith into micro-services is counter-productive.)

    \- "`Monolith -> Services: Theory & Practice <https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/monolith-services-theory-practice-617e4546a879>`__" by Kent Beck

Thus, when one developer writes an unreadable code for 9% of his time, this code slows down the development velocity of the whole team by 91%.
The code is written once, but is read incommensurably many times in the development process.

The emphasis on "fast writing" code actually leads to reduction in the development velocity in geometric progression. And the emphasis on "readability" of code leads to an increase in the development velocity, also in an geometric progression.

The number of objects an average human can hold in `working memory is 7 ± 2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two>`__.
That's why good `decomposition is important <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EtymologyOfRefactoring.html>`__.
That's why good encapsulation and abstraction are important.

If the code is not readable, has bad code navigation, bad decomposition, a lot of code smells, hight coupling, low cohesion, violates SRP, OCP principles, has poor test coverage, doesn't uses type hinting and doesn't allow to use automated refactoring, then this code slows rate of development for 91% of time of the whole team.

Thus, each developer in the team MUST be a senior developer.
The best way to achieve it is to use XP of Kent Beck.

Experience sharing is the rule №1 for the high-skilled team.
If your team still has the junior developer after two months, your team needs a better manager.

    Pair programming is also not a tutoring session. Sometimes pairs contain one
    partner with much more experience than the other partner. When this is true, the
    first few sessions will look a lot like tutoring. The junior partner will ask lots of
    questions, and type very little. Very quickly, though, the junior partner will start
    catching stupid little mistakes, like unbalanced parentheses. The senior partner will
    notice the help. After a few more weeks, the junior partner will start picking up the
    larger patterns that the senior partner is using, and notice deviations from those
    patterns.

    In a couple of months, typically, the gap between the partners is not nearly so
    noticeable as it was at first. The junior partner is typing more regularly. The pair
    notices that each of them has strengths and weaknesses. Productivity, quality, and
    satisfaction rise.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    So, why does pair programming work for XP? Well, the first value is communication,
    and there are few forms of communication more intense than face-to-face. So, pair
    programming works for XP because it encourages communication. I like to think of
    the analogy of a pool of water. When an important new bit of information is learned
    by someone on the team, it is like putting a drop of dye in the water. Because of the
    pairs switching around all the time, the information rapidly diffuses throughout the
    team just as the dye spreads throughout the pool. Unlike the dye, however, the
    information becomes richer and more intense as it spreads and is enriched by the
    experience and insight of everyone on the team.

    In my experience, pair programming is more productive than dividing the work
    between two programmers and then integrating the results. Pair programming is
    often a sticking point for folks wanting to adopt XP. All I can say is that you should
    get good at it, then try an iteration where you pair for all production code and
    another where you program everything solo. Then you can make your own decision.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)


The second myth. Quality code is not suitable for hot deadline.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Team doesn't have time to write high-quality code, because they have a hot deadline.

In reality you have the hot deadline because you have the unpredictable codebase which requires a lot of your time.
You spend a lot of time to try to understand messy mishmash of a code.
Sometimes you are able to understand the code only with debugger.
Your code has a poor test coverage, therefore you spend a lot of time for bugfixes.
Sometimes you are not able to implement a some feature due to poor design, but you also can't to refactor the code because of the poor test coverage.
Your code has a lot of duplicates which are the cause of a lot of bugs.

    The General Principle of Software Quality is
    that improving quality reduces development costs.

    Understanding this principle depends on understanding a key observation: the best way
    to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code, whether
    the rework arises from changes in requirements, changes in design, or debugging. The
    industry-average productivity for a software product is about 10 to 50 of lines of
    delivered code per person per day (including all noncoding overhead). It takes only a
    matter of minutes to type in 10 to 50 lines of code, so how is the rest of the day spent?
    Part of the reason for these seemingly low productivity figures is that industry average
    numbers like these factor nonprogrammer time into the lines-of-code-per-day figure.
    Tester time, project manager time, and administrative support time are all included.
    Noncoding activities, such as requirements development and architecture work, are also
    typically factored into those lines-of-code-per-day figures. But none of that is what
    takes up so much time.

    The single biggest activity on most projects is debugging and correcting code that
    doesn't work properly. Debugging and associated refactoring and other rework consume
    about 50 percent of the time on a traditional, naive software-development cycle. (See
    Section 3.1, "Importance of Prerequisites," for more details.) Reducing debugging by
    preventing errors improves productivity. Therefore, the most obvious method of
    shortening a development schedule is to improve the quality of the product and decrease
    the amount of time spent debugging and reworking the software.
    This analysis is confirmed by field data. In a review of 50
    development projects involving over 400 work-years of effort and
    almost 3 million lines of code, a study at NASA's Software
    Engineering Laboratory found that increased quality assurance was
    associated with decreased error rate but did not increase overalldevelopment cost (Card 1987).

    A study at IBM produced similar findings:

    Software projects with the lowest levels of defects had the shortest development
    schedules and the highest development productivity.... software defect removal is
    actually the most expensive and time-consuming form of work for software (Jones
    2000).

    The same effect holds true at the small end of the scale. In a 1985
    study, 166 professional programmers wrote programs from the
    same specification. The resulting programs averaged 220 lines of
    code and a little under five hours to write. The fascinating result
    was that programmers who took the median time to complete their
    programs produced programs with the greatest number of errors.
    The programmers who took more or less than the median time
    produced programs with significantly fewer errors (DeMarco and
    Lister 1985).

    The two slowest groups took about five times as long to achieve roughly the same
    defect rate as the fastest group. It's not necessarily the case that writing software without
    defects takes more time than writing software with defects. As the graph shows, it can
    take less.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Watts Humphrey reports that teams using the Team Software Process
    (TSP) have achieved defect levels of about 0.06 defects per 1000 lines of code.
    TSP focuses on training developers not to create defects in the first place (Weber
    2003).

    The results of the TSP and cleanroom projects confirm another version of the General
    Principle of Software Quality: it's cheaper to build high-quality software than it is to
    build and fix low-quality software. Productivity for a fully checked-out, 80,000-line
    cleanroom project was 740 lines of code per work-month. The industry average rate for
    fully checked-out code is closer to 250–300 lines per work-month, including all
    noncoding overhead (Cusumano et al 2003). The cost savings and productivity come
    from the fact that virtually no time is devoted to debugging on TSP or cleanroom
    projects. No time spent on debugging? That is truly a worthy goal!

..

    Quality is another strange variable. Often, by insisting on better quality you can get
    projects done sooner, or you can get more done in a given amount of time. This
    happened to me when I started writing unit tests...
    As soon as I had my tests, I had so much more
    confidence in my code that I wrote faster, without stress. I could clean up my
    system more easily, which made further development easier. I've also seen this
    happen with teams. As soon as they start testing, or as soon as they agree on coding
    standards, they start going faster.

    There is a strange relationship between internal and external quality. External quality
    is quality as measured by the customer. Internal quality is quality as measured by
    the programmers. Temporarily sacrificing internal quality to reduce time to market in
    hopes that external quality won't suffer too much is a tempting short-term play. And
    you can often get away with making a mess for a matter of weeks or months.
    Eventually, though, internal quality problems will catch up with you and make your
    software prohibitively expensive to maintain, or unable to reach a competitive level
    of external quality.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    Why can't you just listen, write a test case, make it run, listen, write a test case,
    make it run indefinitely? Because we know it doesn't work that way. You can do that
    for a while. In a forgiving language you may even be able to do that for a long while.
    Eventually, though, you get stuck. The only way to make the next test case run is to
    break another. Or the only way to make the test case run is far more trouble than it
    is worth. Entropy claims another victim.

    The only way to avoid this is to design. Designing is creating a structure that
    organizes the logic in the system. Good design organizes the logic so that a change
    45 in one part of the system doesn't always require a change in another part of the system.
    Good design ensures that every piece of logic in the system has one and only one home.
    Good design puts the logic near the data it operates allows the extension of the system with changes in only one place.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

    ... the activity of design is not an option. It must be given serious thought for software development to be effective.

    The way to go fast, and to keep the deadlines at bay, is to stay clean.
    Professionals do not succumb to the temptation to create a mess in order to move quickly. 
    Professionals realize that "quick and dirty" is an oxymoron. Dirty always means slow!
    ("Clean Coder" [#fnccoder]_ by Robert Martin)

..

    A six-month study conducted by IBM found that maintenance programmers "most often said that **understanding the original programmer's intent was the most difficult problem**" (Fjelstad and Hamlen 1979).
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have
    a shared understanding of the system design. **This shared understanding is called ‘architecture.’**
    This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces.
    These components are usually composed of smaller components, but the architecture only
    includes the components and interfaces that are understood by all the developers.
    (`Ralph Johnson <https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf>`__)


As Martin Fowler said:

    ... the true value of internal quality - that it's the enabler to speed. The purpose of internal quality is to go faster.
    ("`Tradable Quality Hypothesis <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    In most contexts higher quality ⇒ expensive. But high internal quality of software allows us to develop features faster and cheaper.
    ("`Tradable Quality Hypothesis <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    The value of good software design is economic: you can continue to add new functionality quickly even as the code-base grows in size.

    We usually perceive that it costs more to get higher quality, but software internal quality actually reduces costs.

    \- Martin Fowler, "`Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html>`__"

..

    The fundamental role of internal quality is that it lowers the cost of future change.
    But there is some extra effort required to write good software, which does impose some cost in the short term.

    \- Martin Fowler, "`Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html>`__"

..

    Sadly, software developers usually don't do a good job of explaining this situation.
    Countless times I've talked to development teams who say "they (management) won't let us write good quality code because it takes too long".
    Developers often justify attention to quality by justifying through the need for proper professionalism.
    But this moralistic argument implies that this quality comes at a cost - dooming their argument.
    The annoying thing is that the resulting crufty code both makes developers' lives harder, and costs the customer money.
    When thinking about internal quality, I stress that we should only approach it as an economic argument.
    High internal quality reduces the cost of future features, meaning that putting the time into writing good code actually reduces cost.

    This is why the question that heads this article misses the point.
    The "cost" of high internal quality software is negative.
    The usual trade-off between cost and quality, one that we are used to for most decisions in our life, does not make sense with the internal quality of software.
    (It does for external quality, such as a carefully crafted user-experience.)
    Because the relationship between cost and internal quality is an unusual and counter-intuitive relationship, it's usually hard to absorb.
    But understanding it is critical to developing software at maximum efficiency.

    Refactoring Helps Me Program Faster

    In the end, all the earlier points come down to this: Refactoring helps me develop code more quickly.

    This sounds counterintuitive.
    When I talk about refactoring, people can easily see that it improves quality.
    Better internal design, readability, reducing bugs—all theseimprove quality.
    But doesn’t the time I spend on refactoring reduce the speed of development?

    When I talk to software developers who have been working on a system for a while, I often hear that they were able to make progress rapidly at first, but now it takes much longer to add new features.
    Every new feature requires more and more time to understand how to fit it into the existing code base, and once it’s added, bugs often crop up that take even longer to fix.
    The code base starts looking like a series of patches covering patches, and it takes an exercise in archaeology to figure out how things work.
    This burden slows down adding new features — to the point that developers wish they could start again from a blank slate.

    I can visualize this state of affairs with :ref:`the following pseudograph <design-stamina-graph-en>`.

    But some teams report a different experience.
    They find they can add new features faster because they can leverage the existing things by quickly building on what’s already there.

    The difference between these two is the internal quality of the software.
    Software with a good internal design allows me to easily find how and where I need to make changes to add a new feature.
    Good modularity allows me to only have to understand a small subset of the code base to make a change.
    If the code is clear, I’m less likely to introduce a bug, and if I do, the debugging effort is much easier.
    Done well, my code base turns into a platform for building new features for its domain.

    I refer to this effect as the `Design Stamina Hypothesis <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html>`__:
    By putting our effort into a good internal design, we increase the stamina of the software effort, allowing us to go faster for longer.
    I can’t prove that this is the case, which is why I refer to it as a hypothesis.
    But it explains my experience, together with the experience of hundreds of great programmers that I’ve got to know over my career.

    Twenty years ago, the conventional wisdom was that to get this kind of good design, it had to be completed before starting to program — because once we wrote the code, we could only face decay.
    Refactoring changes this picture. We now know we can improve the design of existing code—so we can form and improve a design over time, even as the needs of the program change.
    Since it is very difficult to do a good design up front, refactoring becomes vital to achieving that virtuous path of rapid functionality.

    \- "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" [#fnrefactoring]_ 2nd edition by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, Don Roberts

..

    The whole point of good design and clean code is to make you go faster - if it didn't people like Uncle Bob, Kent Beck, and Ward Cunningham wouldn't be spending time talking about it.

    \- "`Technical Debt Quadrant <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html>`__" by Martin Fowler

There is only one way to develop a software quickly: to do it in the right way for the first time.

The third myth. Pair programming reduces the velocity of development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an opinion that pair programming reduces the velocity of development.

    Studies at the Software Engineering
    Institute have found that developers insert an average of 1 to 3
    defects per hour into their designs and 5 to 8 defects per hour into
    code (Humphrey 1997), so attacking these blind spots is a key to
    effective construction.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    The primary purpose of collaborative construction is to improve
    software quality. As noted in Chapter 20, "The Software-Quality
    Landscape," software testing has limited effectiveness when used
    alone—the average defect-detection rate is only about 30 percent
    for unit testing, 35 percent for integration testing, and 35 percent
    for low-volume beta testing. In contrast, the average
    effectivenesses of design and code inspections are 55 and 60
    percent (Jones 1996). The secondary benefit of collaborative
    construction is that it decreases development time, which in turn
    lowers development costs.

    Early reports on pair programming suggest that it can achieve a
    code-quality level similar to formal inspections (Shull et al 2002).
    The cost of full-up pair programming is probably higher than the
    cost of solo development—on the order of 10–25 percent higher—
    but the reduction in development time appears to be on the order of
    45 percent, which in some cases may be a decisive advantage over
    solo development (Boehm and Turner 2004), although not over
    inspections which have produced similar results.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    A number of these cases illustrate the General Principle of Software Quality, which
    holds that reducing the number of defects in the software also improves development
    time.

    Various studies have shown that in addition to being more effective
    at catching errors than testing, collaborative practices find different
    kinds of errors than testing does (Myers 1978; Basili, Selby, and
    Hutchens 1986). As Karl Wiegers points out, "A human reviewer
    can spot unclear error messages, inadequate comments, hard-coded
    variable values, and repeated code patterns that should be
    consolidated. Testing won't" (Wiegers 2002). A secondary effect is
    that when people know their work will be reviewed, they scrutinize
    it more carefully. Thus, even when testing is done effectively,
    reviews or other kinds of collaboration are needed as part of a
    comprehensive quality program.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Informal review procedures were passed on from person to person in the general culture
    of computing for many years before they were acknowledged in print. The need for
    reviewing was so obvious to the best programmers that they rarely mentioned it in print,
    while the worst programmers believed they were so good that their work did not need
    reviewing. (Daniel Freedman and Gerald Weinberg)

..

    In addition to feedback about how well they follow standards, programmers need
    feedback about more subjective aspects of programming: formatting, comments,
    variable names, local and global variable use, design approaches, the-way-we-do-
    things-around-here, and so on. Programmers who are still wet behind the ears need
    guidance from those who are more knowledgeable, and more knowledgeable
    programmers who tend to be busy need to be encouraged to spend time sharing what
    they know. Reviews create a venue for more experienced and less experienced
    programmers to communicate about technical issues. As such, reviews are an
    opportunity for cultivating quality improvements in the future as much as in the present.

    One team that used formal inspections reported that inspections quickly brought all the
    developers up to the level of the best developers (Tackett and Van Doren 1999).
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Collective Ownership Applies to All Forms of Collaborative Construction

    With collective ownership, all code is owned by the group rather than by individuals
    and can be accessed and modified by various members of the group. This produces
    several valuable benefits:

    - Better code quality arises from multiple sets of eyes seeing the code and multiple programmers working on the code.
    - The impact of someone leaving the project is lessened because multiple people are familiar with each section of code.
    - Defect-correction cycles are shorter overall because any of several programmers can potentially be assigned to fix bugs on an as-available basis.

    Some methodologies, such as Extreme Programming, recommend formally pairing
    programmers and rotating their work assignments over time. At my company, we've
    found that programmers don't need to pair up formally to achieve good code coverage.
    Over time we achieve cross-coverage through a combination of formal and informal
    technical reviews, pair programming when needed, and rotation of defectcorrection
    assignments.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Pair programming produces numerous benefits:

    - It holds up better under stress than solo development. Pairs encourage each other to keep code quality high even when there's pressure to write quick and dirty code.
    - It improves code quality. The readability and understandability of the code tends to rise to the level of the best programmer on the team.
    - It shortens schedules. Pairs tend to write code faster and with fewer errors. The project team spends less time at the end of the project correcting defects.
    - It produces all the other general benefits of collaborative construction, including disseminating corporate culture, mentoring junior programmers, and fostering collective ownership.

    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    Pair programming typically costs about the same as inspections and produces
    similar quality code. Pair programming is especially valuable when schedule
    reduction is desired. Some developers prefer working in pairs to working solo.
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

..

    In my experience, pair programming is more productive than dividing the work
    between two programmers and then integrating the results.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

The main conclusion is that you can't say about affect of pair programming to velocity of development until you begin to track the time of your team for bugfixes, refactoring and debugging.

Please do not confuse "Inspection" [#fncodec]_ (or "Code Reading" [#fncodec]_) and usual Code Review on github.
Inspection is a kind of Collaborative Development Practice, while usual Code Review usually involves only 2 persons (reviewer and author).
Code Review is weak for experience sharing.
Also, usual Code Review does not require any preparation.

    90 percent of the defects were
    found in preparation for the review meeting, and only about 10
    percent were found during the review itself (Votta 1991, Glass
    1999).
    ("Code Complete" [#fncodec]_ by Steve McConnell)

There was one real example of my practice.
We had a ticket for 3 days of development had been assigned to the new developer.
It was a talented developer, but he had a lack of knowledges for the project.

- The new developer solved the ticket during 6 days, because he needed a time to understand the program.
- Then I spent 1-2 days for a few of Code Reviews with fixes.
- Eventually I understood that I spent a lot of time and I approved the incomplete pull request with a lot of design mistakes. Also product team insisted on merge the pull request even with bugs.
- After it, when I was developing my own ticket and I saw that this mistakes interfere to my implementation, I did the refactoring of the mistakes and spent about a day for refactoring.

Thus, we both spent 6 + 2 * 2 + 1 = 11 days.
If we used "Continued Review" of XP we would spent 3 * 2 = 6 days + growing the skills of the new developer.
Next time he would be able to solve the issue independently.

    "I’m not going to quote studies at you, although there are some that could be quoted.
    I’m not going to tell you any anecdotes, although there are many I could tell.
    I’m not even going to tell you how much you should pair.
    All I’m going to tell you is that professionals pair."
    ("Clean Coder" [#fnccoder]_ by Robert Martin)


The fourth myth. Theory and practice are two different things.
--------------------------------------------------------------

There is an opinion that theory and practice are two different things.

In reality the theory is the research of the practice.
Do you want to solder own processor, or write own assembler to create own website?
You use the collective knowledges instead of it.
The life of a human is to short to reproduce the evolutional way of the IT-industry in isolation.
Code development is too complicated science today.
Several outstanding developers have dedicated their lives to collecting and systematizing collective knowledges.
They wrote books with the collectives knowledge for you.
Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Robert Marting, Steve McConnel, Eric Evans, Mark Lutz, Erich Gamma, Niklaus Wirth, Donald Knuth, Christopher Date and others.
If a developer thinks he is able to obtain the experience himself, isolated from the collective knowledges, he looks like an odd man who wants to solder own processor for his web-site...))

There is 5 fundamental books which must be read by each professional:

1. "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides
#. "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" Martin Fowler, David Rice, Matthew Foemmel, Edward Hieatt, Robert Mee, Randy Stafford
#. "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, Don Roberts
#. "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" Robert C. Martin
#. "Code Complete" Steve McConnell

I recommend to read the books in the given order.


The fifth myth. Quality code is perfectionism and excess of complicated design patterns.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people thinks that quality always has a lot of complicated design patterns and, therefore, it is too difficult.
Let me open, for example, motivation of the pattern Mediator.

    "Mediator promotes loose **coupling** by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly,
    and it lets you vary their interaction independently."
    ("Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" [#fndp]_)

The key word in the quote is the word "Coupling_".
The `low coupling and high cohesion <Coupling_>`__ is the most important criteria of code quality.
Low coupling reduces the complexity of the code.
It's simplification, not the complication.
It allows to limit the attention necessary to understand this responsibility of the code.
Thus, patterns is not complexity.

The quality code is always simple!

    "On the surface, being an XP programmer looks a lot like being a programmer within
    other software development disciplines. You spend your time working with programs,
    making them bigger, simpler, faster. Beneath the surface, however, the focus is
    quite different. Your job isn't over when the computer understands what to do. Your
    first value is communication with other people. If the program runs, but there is
    some vital component of communication left to be done, you aren't done. You write
    tests that demonstrate some vital aspect of the software. You break the program
    into more smaller pieces, or merge pieces that are too small into larger, more
    coherent pieces. You find a system of names that more accurately reflects your
    intent.

    This may sound like a high-minded pursuit of perfection. It is anything but. You try
    to develop the most valuable software for the customer, but not to develop anything
    that isn't valuable. If you can reduce the size of the problem enough, then you can
    afford to be careful with the work you do on what remains. Then, you are careful by
    habit."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "Of course, you can
    do a better job if you have more tools in your toolbox than if you have fewer, but it
    is much more important to have a handful of tools that you know when not to use,
    than to know everything about everything and risk using too much solution."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    Mastery - The spirit of xUnit is simplicity. Martin Fowler said, "Never in the annals of 
    software engineering was so much owed by so many to so few lines of code." Some of 
    the implementations have gotten a little complicated for my taste. Rolling your own 
    will give you a tool over which you have a feeling of mastery.
    ("Test-Driven Development By Example" [#fntdd]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "Professionals avoid getting so vested in an idea that they can’t abandon it and 
    turn around. They keep an open mind about other ideas so that when they hit a 
    dead end they still have other options."
    ("Clean Coder" [#fnccoder]_ by Robert Martin)

..

    "A good architecture comes from understanding it more as a journey than as a destination, more as an ongoing process of enquiry than as a frozen artifact."

.. "Когда кто-либо привязывается к одной какой-нибудь, хотя бы и верной, идее, то он, в сущности, попадает в то же положение, в каком находился бы человек, привязавший себя к столбу, для того чтобы не заблудиться. То, что может быть желанной истиной на известной ступени духовного роста, может быть помехой к этому росту и заблуждением на другой, более высокой ступени."

    \- Люси Малори

..

    Travel light - You can't expect to carry a lot of baggage and move fast.
    The artifacts we maintain should be:

    - Few
    - Simple
    - Valuable

    The XP team becomes intellectual nomads, always prepared to quickly pack up the tents and follow the herd.
    The herd in this case might be a design that wants to go a different direction than anticipated, or a customer that wants to go a different direction than anticipated, or a team member who leaves, or a technology that suddenly gets hot, or a business climate that shifts.

    Like the nomads, the XP team gets used to traveling light.
    They don't carry much in the way of baggage except what they must have to keep producing value for the customer—tests and code.

    <...>

    Travel light - suggests that the manager doesn't impose a lot of overhead - long all-hands meetings, lengthy status reports.
    Whatever the manager requires of the programmers shouldn't take much time to fulfill.

    <...>

    Travel light - The design strategy should produce no "extra" design.
    There should be enough to suit our current purposes (the need to do quality work), but no more.
    If we embrace change, we will be willing to start simple and continually refine.

    \- "Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck

..

    "It's hard to do simple things. It seems crazy, but sometimes it is easier to do
    something more complicated than to do something simple. This is particularly true
    when you have been successful doing the complicated thing in the past. Learning to
    see the world in the simplest possible terms is a skill and a challenge. The challenge
    is that you may have to change your value system. Instead of being impressed when
    someone (like you, for instance) gets something complicated to work, you have to
    learn to be dissatisfied with complexity, not to rest until you can't imagine anything
    simpler working."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "I like my code to be elegant and efficient.
    The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide,
    the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy,
    and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations.
    Clean code does one thing well."

The sixth myth. The agile never works.
--------------------------------------

    "Scrum is ok if you do it right." (`Robert Martin <https://youtu.be/0oGpWmS0aYQ>`__)

..

    "One pattern I see time and time again on software teams is that they adopt Scrum, pay little attention to technical practices, and they’re able to consistently increase their velocity for the first few years.
    But after about three or four years the technical debt they’ve accumulated in their code is so great that their velocity starts to grind to a halt and they find it difficult to even get simple features implemented.
    This is a place you do not want to get to, though I see it far too often in the software community—teams stuck there without a clue how to get out."
    ("`How to Increase Velocity <https://www.agilealliance.org/how-to-increase-velocity/>`__" by David Bernstein)

Often people understand the word "agile" as a simple set of iterations.
But the true agile is to keep the cost of code change low, so the customer will be able to adapt the codebase for variable business requirements.

   :alt: The cost of change rising exponentially over time. The image from the book "Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck.
   :align: center


The cost of change rising exponentially over time. The image from the book "Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck.

    At the core of understanding this argument is the software change curve.
    The change curve says that as the project runs, it becomes exponentially more expensive to make changes.
    The change curve is usually expressed in terms of phases "a change made in analysis for $1 would cost thousands to fix in production".
    This is ironic as most projects still work in an ad-hoc process that doesn't have an analysis phase, but the exponentiation is still there.
    The exponential change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work.
    It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation.

    The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work.
    This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP.
    This is part of the coupling of the XP practices: specifically you can't do those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing those things that enable the flattening.
    This is a common source of the controversy over XP.
    Many people criticize the exploitation without understanding the enabling.
    Often the criticisms stem from critics' own experience where they didn't do the enabling practices that allow the exploiting practices to work.
    As a result they got burned and when they see XP they remember the fire.
    ("`Is Design Dead? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    "If you're a manager or customer how can you tell if the software is well designed?
    It matters to you because poorly designed software will be more expensive to modify in the future."
    ("`Is Design Dead? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)


.. image:: /_media/en/how-to-quickly-develop-high-quality-code/asymptotic-cost-of-change.png
   :alt: The cost of change may not rise dramatically over time. The image from the book "Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck.
   :align: center


The cost of change may not rise dramatically over time. The image from the book "Extreme Programming" by Kent Beck.

    "This is one of the premises of XP. It is the technical premise of XP. If the cost of
    change rose slowly over time, you would act completely differently from how you do
    under the assumption that costs rise exponentially. You would make big decisions as
    late in the process as possible, to defer the cost of making the decisions and to have
    the greatest possible chance that they would be right. You would only implement
    what you had to, in hopes that the needs you anticipate for tomorrow wouldn't come
    true. You would introduce elements to the design only as they simplified existing
    code or made writing the next bit of code simpler.

    If a flattened change cost curve makes XP possible, a steep change cost curve makes
    XP impossible. If change is ruinously expensive, you would be crazy to charge ahead
    without careful forethought. But if change stays cheap, the additional value and
    reduced risk of early concrete feedback outweighs the additional cost of early
    change."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

Let me repeat the words of Kent Beck, the creator of the first agile methodology "Extreme Programming": **"If a flattened change cost curve makes XP possible, a steep change cost curve makes XP impossible."**

    "Make the change easy then make the easy change."

    -- Kent Beck, dddeu 20

..

    "Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology developed primarily by Kent Beck.
    XP was one of the first agile methods, indeed XP was the dominant agile method in the late 90s and early 00s before Scrum became dominant as the noughties passed.
    Many people (including myself) consider XP to be the primary catalyst that got attention to agile methods, and superior to Scrum as a base for starting out in agile development."
    ("`Extreme Programming <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    "In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster.
    The design ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc tactical decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter.
    In many ways you might argue this is no design, certainly it usually leads to a poor design.
    As Kent puts it, design is there to enable you to keep changing the software easily in the long term.
    As design deteriorates, so does your ability to make changes effectively.
    You have the state of software entropy, over time the design gets worse and worse.
    Not only does this make the software harder to change, it also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely kill.
    This is the "code and fix" nightmare, where the bugs become exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on."
    ("`Is Design Dead? <https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    "To make agile work, you need solid technical practices.
    A lot of agile education under-emphasizes these, but if you skimp on this you won't gain the productivity and responsiveness benefits that agile development can give you (stranding you at level 1 of the agile fluency model.)
    This is one of the reasons that I still think that Extreme Programming is the most valuable of the named agile methods as a core and starting point."
    ("`Agile Software Development <https://martinfowler.com/agile.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    "From the very earliest days of agile methods, people have asked what role there is for architectural or design thinking.
    A common misconception is that since agile methods drop the notion of a detailed up-front design artifact, that there is no room for architecture in an agile project.
    In my keynote at the first-ever agile conference, I pointed out that design was every bit as important for agile projects, but it manifests itself differently, becoming an evolutionary approach."
    ("`Agile Software Development <https://martinfowler.com/agile.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)

..

    McConnell writes, "In ten years the pendulum has swung from 'design everything' to 'design nothing.'
    But the alternative to BDUF [Big Design Up Front] isn't no design up front, it's a Little Design Up Front (LDUF) or Enough Design Up Front (ENUF)."
    This is a strawman argument.
    The alternative to designing before implementing is designing after implementing.
    Some design up-front is necessary, but just enough to get the initial implementation.
    Further design takes place once the implementation is in place and the real constraints on the design are obvious.
    Far from "design nothing," the XP strategy is "design always."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ 2nd edition by Kent Beck)


In short, if your team is not experienced in software design, the agile methodology will fail anyway.
That's the main reason why Agile was invented and popularized by the great software architects - Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin and others, they knew how to keep the cost of code change low.

The seventh myth. It is enough to hire smart developers to have rapid development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it's great to have smart developers, but there is a "problem of smart people".

    "Really smart programmers sometimes have a hard time with XP. Sometimes the
    smart people have the hardest time trading the "Guess Right" game for close
    communication and continuous evolution."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "It doesn't take a Ph.D. in computer science to contribute to an XP project (in fact, the Ph.D.'s sometimes have the most trouble)."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    XP works against many programmers' instincts. As programmers, we get in the habit
    of anticipating problems. When they appear later, we're happy. When they don't
    appear, we don't notice. So the design strategy will have to go sideways of this
    "guessing at the future" behavior. Fortunately, most folks can unlearn the habit of
    "borrowing trouble" (as my grandmother called it). Unfortunately, the smarter you
    are, the harder it will be to unlearn.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "It's hard to collaborate. Our whole education system is tuned to individual
    achievement. If you work with someone on a project, the teacher calls it cheating
    and punishes you. The reward systems in most companies, with individual
    evaluations and raises (often cast as a zero sum game), also encourages individual thinking.
    You will likely have to learn new people skills, interacting as closely with your team as you will in XP."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    When Development is in charge, they put in place all the process and technology
    that they never had time for when "those suits" were pushing them around. They
    install new tools, new languages, new technologies. And the tools, languages, and
    66technologies are chosen because they are interesting and cutting edge. Cutting edge
    implies risk. (If we haven't learned that by now, when will we?)
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "You try to make the infrastructure cover everything you think you might need,
    which leads to an overly complex infrastructure."
    ("Planning Extreme Programming" [#fnpxp]_ by Kent Beck, Martin Fowler)

..

    "In teaching TDD, I see this situation all the time—excellent software engineers 
    spending 5 to 10 minutes reasoning about a question that the computer could answer in 15 
    seconds. Without the tests you have no choice, you have to reason. With the tests you can 
    decide whether an experiment would answer the question faster. Sometimes you should just 
    ask the computer."
    ("Test-Driven Development By Example" [#fntdd]_ by Kent Beck)

The cause of this effect is that smart people tends to think in upfront way.
Furthermore, usually the developer does not have enough information to make right decisions about implementation at the moment.
Therefore the developer has to spend a lot of time to gather necessary information.
Often it is not possible to collect all necessary information and the developer makes a wrong decision, which must be changed in the future.

    "We often forget that it is also best to postpone decisions until the last possible moment.
    This isn’t lazy or irresponsible; it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information.
    A premature decision is a decision made with suboptimal knowledge. We will have that
    much less customer feedback, mental reflection on the project, and experience with our
    implementation choices if we decide too soon."
    ("Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" [#fnccode]_ by Robert C. Martin)

..

    "You would make big decisions as
    late in the process as possible, to defer the cost of making the decisions and to have
    the greatest possible chance that they would be right. You would only implement
    what you had to, in hopes that the needs you anticipate for tomorrow wouldn't come
    true."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

Thus, usually upfront thinking is expensive.

    "Short-term individual goals often conflict with long-term social goals."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

The smarter developer, the longer term goals he tends to think for.
See also article "`The Case for Slow Programming <https://ventrellathing.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/the-case-for-slow-programming/>`__".
But the real problem is not the intellect of a developer, but the methodology of work.
I.e. this is the management problem.

    "Actually, if programmers could always make
    decisions that carefully balanced short-term and long-term priorities, there would be
    no need for any other technical people on the project besides programmers."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    "Programmers want to tackle high-risk stories first, and customers want to tackle high-value stories first.
    There are plenty of times when these conflicting priorities have to be resolved."
    ("Planning Extreme Programming" [#fnpxp]_ by Kent Beck, Martin Fowler)

..

    It's been tricky, designing a process where following short-term self-interest also
    serves long-term team interest. You can expound all you want on how some practice
    or other is in everybody's best interest long-term, but when the pressure mounts, if
    the practice doesn't solve an immediate problem it will be discarded. If XP can't work
    with people's short-term interest, it is doomed to the outer methodological darkness.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

To be effective, the smart developer has to understand the economy of software development, has to have enough knowledges about design and architecture, and has to use "`Designing Through Refactoring <Use Designing Through Refactoring_>`_".
Smart developers usually tend to work fast only with smart managers.
If a manager does not able to use potential of smart developers in iterative way, the smart developers usually tend to find a lot of non-iterative upfront things ("borrowing trouble") for their brain.
But the economy always wins.

    If the cost of today's decision is high, and the probability of its being right is low, and
    the probability of knowing a better way tomorrow is high, and the cost of putting in
    the design tomorrow is low, then we can conclude that we should never make a
    design decision today if we don't need it today. In fact, that is what XP concludes.
    "Sufficient to the day are the troubles thereof."

    Now, several factors can make the above evaluation null and void. If the cost of
    making the change tomorrow is very much higher, then we should make the decision
    today on the off chance that we are right. If the inertia of the design is low enough
    (for example, you have really, really smart people), then the benefits of just-in-time
    design are less. If you are a really, really good guesser, then you could go ahead and
    design everything today. For the rest of us, however, I don't see any alternative to
    the conclusion that today's design should be done today and tomorrow's design
    should be done tomorrow.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)


Advices
=======

Use catalog of refactorings
---------------------------

Don't spend a lot of time for explanations at code review.
You can simple use link to certain method of refactoring by using `Catalog of Refactorings`_.
Pay attention, each method of refactoring has the page number of the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" [#fnrefactoring]_ by Martin Fowler, where any developer can find the comprehensive information for the method with examples.

There are also online catalogs of refactorings for database:

- http://www.databaserefactoring.com/
- http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoringCatalog.html

..

    "Change is the only constant." ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)


Use catalogs of code smells
---------------------------

Do you want to avoid the war of opinions and save a lot of team's time?
Ground your arguments on knowledge, instead of opinion, when you do code review.
Use catalogs of Code Smells.
There is a few of most frequently used catalogs:

- Chapter 17: "Smells and Heuristics" of the book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" [#fnccode]_ by Robert C. Martin
- Chapter 3. "Bad Smells in Code" of the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" [#fnrefactoring]_ by Martin Fowler
- `Code Smell`_
- "Refactoring To Patterns" [#fnrtp]_


Use Designing Through Refactoring
---------------------------------

More info on approach of "Designing Through Refactoring" you can find in the chapter "Refactoring and Design" of the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" [#fnrefactoring]_ by Martin Fowler and in the chapter "Chapter 17. Design Strategy" of the book "Extreme programming" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck.
This approach is unbelievable effective when you use Type Hinting declaration (more info `here <https://github.com/python-rope/rope/blob/master/docs/overview.rst#type-hinting>`__, `here <http://jedi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/features.html#type-hinting>`__ and `here <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html>`__) with a tool for automated refactoring (`rope <https://github.com/python-rope/rope>`_, `refactoring tool of PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/refactoring-source-code.html>`_).

Track and analyze the inefficient time spent
--------------------------------------------

There are several tools to track your time, for example:

- `rescuetime <https://www.rescuetime.com/>`_
- `timescreen <https://bitbucket.org/emacsway/timescreen>`_

I personally use `timescreen`_.
Also I like to use `Pomodoro Technique <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique>`__ with the `Pomodoro timer for GNOME <http://gnomepomodoro.org/>`__.

Track and analyze the inefficient time spent, and you will see how to save a lot of time.

Ineffective waste of time                                      The solution
=============================================================  ===============================================================================
You are forced to see and understand an implementation.        You don't have *to see* the implementation.
                                                               You don't have *to understand* the program, you have *to read* the program.
                                                               You have to read the *interface*, not the *implementation*.
                                                               If the interface is not clear, ask the author to improve it.
                                                               The declaration of public interfaces is important,
                                                               it's a great way to reduce the complexity of the program.
                                                               Code is written once, but it is read many times.
                                                               Make reading the code easy, save the time.

You are forced to understand the program using the debugger.   This violates the Primary Technical Imperative of
                                                               software development "Managing complexity".
                                                               Don't ask the author to improve the code quality, because he can't to do it.
                                                               Introduce a Collaborative Development Practice to share experience:
                                                               XP, Pair Programming, Formal Inspection, Code Reading (don't confuse it
                                                               with usual Code Review).
                                                               Ask some experienced developer to refactor the complicated part of code,
                                                               and share the solution with the author to improve his skills.
                                                               Remember the quotes:

                                                                   "The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size
                                                                   of his own skull; therefore, he approaches the programming task
                                                                   in full humility"
                                                                   (Dijkstra 1972).

                                                               ..

                                                                   "Be Humble, don’t think of yourself as a super genius,
                                                                   this is your first mistake.
                                                                   By being humble, you will eventually achieve super genius status =),
                                                                   and even if you don’t, who cares!
                                                                   your code is stupid simple,
                                                                   so you don’t have to be a genius to work with it."
                                                                   (`KISS principle <https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html>`__)

You are forced to debug and to fix bugs.                       Introduce `Test-Driven Development`_ (TDD), improve the quality of code
                                                               and the corporate culture of code construction.
                                                               The time of debugging and bug fixing is one of the important
                                                               measurement parameters.
                                                               The main goal of TDD is saving the time.
                                                               Also TDD improves the code quality, because it is easier to write well
                                                               decomposed classes with low coupling and clear responsibility
                                                               than to be thinking how to test a tangled mishmash.

A lot of discussions in the team. A war of opinions.           A lot of discussions means the lack of the knowledges.
                                                               Where there is knowledge, there is not a lot of discussions,
                                                               and everyone knows what and how to do it.
                                                               Introduce using of a catalog of code smells, the catalog of refactorings,
                                                               the approach of "Designing Through Refactoring".
                                                               Introduce reading technical literature into corporate culture.

You can't implement a new feature without refactoring.         This is normal if you use the approach of "Designing Through Refactoring".
                                                               But if the cause is a lack of design skills,
                                                               you have to improve the skills of the team.
                                                               Introduce a Collaborative Development Practice to share experience.

Create motivation
-----------------

Many times I saw how talented developers lost motivation due to management mistakes and left the company.
Once I saw how the tight-knit collective with high self-motivation was destroyed for a couple of weeks after the change of the management.

    "Quality means doing it right when no one is looking." (Henry Ford)

..

    There is a human effect from quality. Everybody wants to do a good job, and they
    work much better if they feel they are doing good work. If you deliberately
    downgrade quality, your team might go faster at first, but soon the demoralization of
    producing crap will overwhelm any gains you temporarily made from not testing, or
    not reviewing, or not sticking to standards.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    This points to a deeper value, one that lies below the surface of the other four —
    respect. If members of a team don't care about each other and what they are doing,
    XP is doomed.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

..

    If members of a team don't care about the project, nothing can
    save it. Given some minimal passion, XP provides some positive feedback. This is not
    manipulative; it's just enjoying being part of something that works, instead of part of
    something that doesn't work.
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)


Be fair and honest
------------------

It worth to read chapter "33.4. Intellectual Honesty" of "Code Complete" [#fncodec]_.

    "Any fool can defend his or her mistakes—and most fools do." (Dale Carnegie)


Be courageous
-------------

It worth to read chapter "Chapter 7. Four Values: Courage" of "Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_.

..

    "programmers will have to wrestle with the messy real world." (Steve McConnel)


Keep improving yourself
-----------------------

One company asks the question to new candidates:

    "What have you learned in the last year and what would you like to learn next?"

Ask this question to yourself and everyone in the team.

    "Specific features of the technical environment change every 5 to 10 years.
    If you aren't curious enough to keep up with the changes,
    you might find yourself down at the old-programmers' home playing cards with T-Bone
    Rex and the Brontosaurus sisters."
    ("Code Complete" by Steve McConnell [#fncodec]_)

..

    "A little reading goes a long way toward professional advancement. If you read even one
    good programming book every two months, roughly 35 pages a week, you'll soon have
    a firm grasp on the industry and distinguish yourself from nearly everyone around you."
    ("Code Complete" by Steve McConnell [#fncodec]_)

..

    "We become authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres
    by so many separate acts and hours of work.
    If a person keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day,
    he can count on waking up some morning to find himself one of the competent
    ones of his generation."
    (William James [#fncodec]_)


Use Extreme Progrgramming (XP)
------------------------------

    "XP is a lightweight, efficient, low-risk, flexible, predictable, scientific, and fun way to develop software."
    ("Extreme Programming Explained" [#fnxp]_ by Kent Beck)

"`Extreme Programming Explained`_" by Kent Beck is one of the most valuable books I've ever read.

    "To make agile work, you need solid technical practices.
    A lot of agile education under-emphasizes these, but if you skimp on this you won't gain the productivity and responsiveness benefits that agile development can give you (stranding you at level 1 of the agile fluency model.)
    This is one of the reasons that I still think that Extreme Programming is the most valuable of the named agile methods as a core and starting point."
    ("`Agile Software Development <https://martinfowler.com/agile.html>`__" by Martin Fowler)
